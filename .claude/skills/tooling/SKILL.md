# Web3 Security Tooling

## Scope

Use this skill when adding or organizing:

- Static analyzers (Slither, Mythril, etc.)
- Fuzzers / property testing (Echidna, Foundry, etc.)
- Decompilers / bytecode tooling
- Compilers and toolchains
- Monitoring and relayer services

## Categorization Rules

- **General-purpose dev/security tools** go under `Development → Tools`.
- **Language toolchains** go under `Development → Compilers`.
- **Decompilers** go under `Development → Decompilers`.
- **Frameworks** go under `Development → Development Frameworks`.
- **Testing frameworks** go under `Development → Unit Tests` (only if testing-focused).

## Quality Bar

- Prefer canonical repos
- Avoid forks unless they add meaningful features
- Add short, English descriptions
- Never duplicate an existing URL
