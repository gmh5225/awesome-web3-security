# MEV Security

## Scope

Use this skill for:

- MEV concepts and threat models
- Sandwich/frontrunning/backrunning patterns
- Mitigations and private transaction relays

## Concepts (Quick List)

- Transaction ordering and block building
- Sandwich attacks
- Arbitrage and liquidation extraction
- Private order flow / private mempool

## Mitigations

- Private transaction relays / RPC endpoints
- MEV blockers
- Commit-reveal patterns (where applicable)
- Slippage protection and simulation

## Where to Add Links in README

- MEV concept resources: `DeFi Topics → MEV`
- MEV defense tooling (RPC/relays): `DeFi Topics → MEV` (primary), optionally `Development → Tools` only if the link is a general-purpose dev tool

## Rules

- English descriptions
- No duplicates
